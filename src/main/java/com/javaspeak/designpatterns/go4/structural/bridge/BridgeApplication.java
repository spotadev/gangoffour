/**
 * Text book description:
 * <ul>
 *     Bridge: Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation. Decouple an abstraction 
 *     from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
 * </ul>
 * This application has an abstract class called AbstractShapeBridge which wraps ShapeBuilder so 
 * that calling the buildShape() method of AbstractShapeBridge internally calls the buildShape() 
 * method of the ShapeBuilder.
 * <p>
 * This wrapping allows the implementation of ShapeBuilder, currently TriangleBuilder, to be 
 * readily switched for another implementation such as SquareBuilder.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of the ShapeBuilder is passed through the constructor of AbstractBridge.
 * <p>
 * BridgeImpl extends AbstractBridge and adds its own method, drawShape() to draw the shape.  
 * Internally the drawShape() method makes a call to the buildShape() method in AbstractShapeBridge.
 * <p>
 * This pattern is pretty similar to the Adapter pattern.  Notice some differences though:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *          Adapter is more about wrapping a third party API so it can be used by the application 
 *          API.
 *      </li>
 *     <li>
 *          Bridge is more about having the ability to slot in different implementation.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *          The Bridge has an abstract class that wraps the implementation which is itself extended 
 *          to add extra functionality (e.g. ShapeBridgeImpl.drawShape())
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *          The Bridge pattern in this example can be considered to be a combination of the 
 *          Strategy and Template patterns
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
