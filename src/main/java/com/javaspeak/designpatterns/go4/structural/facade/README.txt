README.txt for the Gang of Four, Structural Facade  pattern
====================================================================================================

Please run the example by running:

    FacadeApplication
    
FacadeApplication has a main method.

If you want to run FacadeApplication from maven type:

     mvn compile
     mvn exec:java@facade
     
Else you can run it from an IDE such as STS. A lot of SpotADev projects use STS as their 
preferred Java IDE.  STS is a spring source version of the Eclipse IDE.  You can easily import 
maven projects into STS. You can find videos on youtube showing you how to install and use STS.
