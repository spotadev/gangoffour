/**
 * Text book description:
 * <ul>
 *     Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes.  Convert the interface of a class into 
 *     another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise 
 *     because of incompatible interfaces.
 * </ul>
 * An Adapter is used to provide a wrapper to a third party class so that it can be called by the 
 * Application.
 * <p>
 * The Application may expect to call a certain method of an interface which is part of its own API.  
 * However we wish to call a method of some other third party API.
 * <p>
 * What we do is we wrap the third party class in an adapter that implements our application API. 
 * When we call the application API method it internally calls the third party implementation.
 * <p>
 * For example imagine the Application client code wishes to call the draw() method on a Square.  
 * Square is part of the application API.
 * <p>
 * We create a ShapeAdapter to wrap ShapeImpl which is part of a third party implementation.
 * <p>
 * When we call draw() on the ShapeAdapter it internally calls drawSquare() on the ShapeImpl class.
 * <p>
 * We have adapted the share.drawSquare() method so that it is executed when we call our application 
 * API square.draw() method.
