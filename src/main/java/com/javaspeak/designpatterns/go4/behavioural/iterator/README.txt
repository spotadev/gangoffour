There is no class with a main method in this example.  Instead we will run a unit test.

If you want to run all unit tests from maven:

     mvn compile
     mvn test
     

If you want to run only the tests for this design pattern:

    mvn compile
    mvn test -Dtest=ConcurrentLinkedListSingleThreadedTest

Else you can run it from an IDE such as STS. A lot of SpotADev projects use STS as their 
preferred Java IDE.  STS is a spring source version of the Eclipse IDE.  You can easily import 
maven projects into STS. You can find videos on youtube showing you how to install and use STS.

You can install a testng plugin into STS to run tests.
