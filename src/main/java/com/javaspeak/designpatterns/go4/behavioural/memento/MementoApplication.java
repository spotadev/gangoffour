/**
 * Text book description:
 * <ul>
 * Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state. Without violating encapsulation, 
 * capture and externalize an objectâ€™s internal state so that the object can be restored to this 
 * state later.
 * </ul>
 * This example uses the Memento pattern for undo operations. In the Memento pattern there is a 
 * Caretaker, Originator and Memento.
 * <p>
 * The Originator is the class that has state that needs to be rolled back  to the previous version.   
 * The Caretaker manages the backup and restoration  of state to the Originator.  The Caretaker asks 
 * the Originator for a  Memento object that holds a snapshot of its current state. The Caretaker  
 * then adds this to a Deque (LIFO queue) it is managing.  Later on an undo operation involves 
 * taking the last Memento put on the LIFO queue and passing  it to the Originator so that the 
 * Originator has the information to roll back  its state to the last saved version.
 * <p>
 * In this example we are modelling the saving operation of a text editor.  Every time  the document 
 * is saved the Caretaker (ApplicationMemento) asks the  Originator (DocumentImpl) for a 
 * DocumentMemento which it adds to a momentoDeque (LIFO queue).  After saving 3 times and printing 
 * the saved text  to the console an undo operation is called two times restoreFromMemento()). 
 * <p>
 * After each undo operation the document text is printed to the console so you can see that the 
 * multiple undo has worked.

     * only want to undo text edits and not change of font size or font family edits.
     * <p>
     * Every time we call saveDocumentText(..) on the Document we also call the saveMemento(..) 
     * method to save the documentText in a DocumentMemento object and place it at the end of a 
     * deque (LIFO queue).
     * <p>

     * the Deque and read the last DocumentMemento still remaining on the the end of the Deque.  We 
     * then use this DocumentMemento to roll back the state of the Document.
